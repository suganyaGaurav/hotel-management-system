# Hotel Management System (Python)

## Project Overview
This project is a **menu-driven Hotel Management System** built using Python.  
It was developed as a **learning and practice project** to understand how real-world systems can be modeled using core programming concepts such as functions, data structures, validation, and control flow.

The system simulates the basic operations of a hotel, including room booking, room availability checks, customer record management, room services, restaurant billing, and total bill generation.

> ⚠️ This is a **learning-focused system**, not a production-ready application.

## Key Features
- Room booking with check-in and check-out date validation
- Multiple room categories with availability tracking
- Customer ID and room number generation
- Room service handling (cleaning, laundry, dining)
- Restaurant menu and food billing
- Total bill calculation per customer
- Record-keeping for all bookings
- Menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Concepts & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- Functions and modular logic
- Dictionaries and lists for in-memory data storage
- `datetime` module for date validation
- Regular Expressions (`re`) for input validation
- Loops and conditional statements
- Menu-driven program design
